# VCFs

Tools to analyze and filter VCF files for cassava

The first script changes the reference allele to the one present in the reference genome.
The ALT allele will be the major allele.

The second script (initial vcf_alternate.py) will do the same but the ALT allele will be now the minor allele.

The script will run in the first 18 chromosome and the output will be ready for SNPeff
